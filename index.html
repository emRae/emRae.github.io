				<p class="lead">Since "Creative Problem Solving" is rather broad, <br> let me break it down a bit.</p>

				<p>I started out interested in painting in high school which led to studying graphic design in college since I wanted to major in something more practical. After college, I pursued a few different avenues. I tried out teaching art. I worked at a printing company doing design and prepress work. Then I got a job doing web design. With the web design job I learned that I have a natural knack towards the technical side of things and where I learned the front-end development skills of html and css along with a little bit of JavaScript, Ruby on Rails, and Git.</p> 

				<p>Now I am basically a theme developer for WordPress and thus know a little bit of PHP. I've also recently taken part of a Data Science course as I was interested in data visualizations and business intelligence for marketing. I am still interested in pursuing something to do with data visualizations in the future. I also still paint as a hobby.</p>

				<p class="lead">In summary, painting > graphic design > print design > web design > web development.</p>
